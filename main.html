    <h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> The time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
	<p>Space complexity measures the total amount of memory that an algorithm or operation needs to run according to its input size.<br>Let’s see a few examples of expressing<b> Space Complexity</b> using big-O notation, starting from slowest space growth (best) to fastest (worst):<br>

O(1) – constant complexity – takes the same amount of space regardless of the input size.<br>
O(log n) – logarithmic complexity – takes space proportional to the log of the input size.<br>
O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size.<br>
O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.<br>
O(n^2) – square/polynomial complexity – space complexity grows proportionally to the square of the input size.</p>
